The `ls` command is used to list files and directories in the current working directory.  

🔹 **Basic Syntax:**  
```bash
ls
```

```bash
ls -l      # Detailed list with permissions, ownership, size, and modification time
ls -a      # Show hidden files (files starting with a dot .)
ls -lh     # Show file sizes in a human-readable format (KB, MB, GB)
ls -lt     # Sort by modification time (newest first)
```

🔹 **Use Cases:**  
✔ Checking available files and directories.  
✔ Viewing hidden files in configuration folders (e.g., `.bashrc`).  
✔ Finding recently modified files using `ls -lt`.  

---

## **2️⃣ cd (Change Directory)**  
The `cd` command allows you to navigate between directories.  

🔹 **Basic Syntax:**  
```bash
cd <directory_name>
```

🔹 **Common Uses:**  
```bash
cd /home/user/Documents   # Navigate to Documents folder
cd ..                     # Move up one directory
cd -                      # Switch back to the last visited directory
cd ~                      # Navigate to home directory
```

🔹 **Use Cases:**  
✔ Moving to project folders.  
✔ Accessing system log files in `/var/log/`.  
✔ Quickly switching between directories using `cd -`.  

---

## **3️⃣ pwd (Print Working Directory)**  
The `pwd` command prints the full path of the current working directory.  

🔹 **Basic Syntax:**  
```bash
pwd
```

🔹 **Use Cases:**  
✔ Useful when working in deeply nested folders.

mkdir -p my_project/src      # Create nested directories in one command
```

🔹 **Use Cases:**  
✔ Creating a new project structure.  
✔ Organizing files into different directories.  
✔ Using `mkdir -p` to create multiple levels at once.  

---

## **5️⃣ rm (Remove Files & Directories)**  
The `rm` command deletes files or directories.  

🔹 **Basic Syntax:**

rm -v file1 file2       # Verbose output while deleting multiple files
```

🔹 **Use Cases:**  
✔ Cleaning up old or unnecessary files.  
✔ Removing temporary log files from `/var/log/`.

```

🔹 **Common Uses:**  
```bash
cat /etc/passwd               # View system user accounts
cat access.log | less         # View large files page by page
cat file1 file2 > combined.txt  # Merge multiple files into one
```

🔹 **Use Cases:**  
✔ Reading small configuration files.  
✔ Quickly displaying file contents.  
✔ Combining multiple files into one.  

---

## **9️⃣ grep (Search in Files)**  
The `grep` command searches for a specific text pattern in files.  

🔹 **Basic Syntax:**  
```bash
grep "search_term" file.txt
